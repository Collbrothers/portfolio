## Summary
Hey there, I'm Aron Kylebäck, a web developer specializing in the Vue.js ecosystem. I'm currently a Developer Coach at Techover Academy, but you've probably peeked at my experience already, so let's get to the good stuff.

Born in 2006 in Skövde, Sweden, I've been interested in computers and technology since I was a kid. My programming hobby started around 6th grade where I was introduced to Microsoft's Micro:bits, a small programmable device used to, well, introduce kids to programming.
Being a curious nerd I wanted to learn more than just basic block programming, so I started watching videos about Javascript and basic web development.

Fast-forward a few years, and I had been working as a freelancer for some time, I found myself doing the same things over and over again, I wasn't learning or getting challenged in my work. Luckily, I found MMR Solutions, a web consulting company where I learned a lot & got to work with some great people. 

MMR Solutions later revamped their business model and became Techover Academy, a coding school where I now work as a Developer Coach.

While I'm not working, I'm usually playing video games, working on my own projects, or geeking out over something else.
