## Introduction
What is a homelab? Why do I have one? What's in it?

I'll answer these questions and more in this post, and explain my plans for the future.

## What is a homelab
Simply put a homelab is a setup of computer and networking equipment in a person's home used for learning, experimenting, and hosting personal projects or websites. It can range from a single computer to a complex network of servers and devices.

## Why do I have one
It began with me wanting to run experiment with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), so I started out with a simple Raspberry pi, but this had some limitations, primarily performance. So what did I do? I started looking at servers and got an amazing deal on an HPE DL380 which was packed with top of the line components.

And since then, I've found more and more software I could run locally. So I got some networking equipment and well here we are.

## What's in it
- HPE DL380 running Esxi 6.7
- Netgear Managed Switch
- Raspberry Pi 4 (4gb) x 3
- 3D Printer (Resin & FDM)

## What's next
- A new router, I'm currently deciding between a self-hosted Pfsense instance or a MikroTik router (if I can get my hands on one).
- A proper UPS, this equipment is expensive and I don't want to roll my dice with Thor.
- A dedicated NAS for plex and backups.
