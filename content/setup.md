# Issues and nitpicks with my setup

- The Odyssey G9 does not support 240Hz when splitting the screen in two, which is a bummer... Thanks, Samsung.
- The 8700K is starting to show its age, but I can't bring myself to upgrade it just yet.
- Two of the QL120 have sadly burned some LEDs resulting in faulty colors, and they are all generally louder than I'd like.
- No HDR support with i3 sadly, I am aware the Wayland is starting to support it, but that requires open source nvidia drivers, which has a substantial performance hit sadly.
